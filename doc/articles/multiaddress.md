A standard way to represent a networks address that supports [multiple network protocols](xref:Ipfs.MultiAddress). It is represented as 
a series of tuples, a protocol code and an optional value.  For example, an IPFS node at a sepcific address over ipv4 and tcp is 

    /ip4/10.1.10.10/tcp/80/p2p/QmVcSqVEsvm5RR9mBLjwpb2XjFVn5bPdPL69mL8PH45pPC
